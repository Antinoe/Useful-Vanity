The main strive for Combat Efficiency is to wear Armor, but that shouldn't be the only option. What if someone wants a lighter alternative?

Vanity sets have remained a merely cosmetic part of Terraria. This project will do away with that concept and make them a viable choice in combat.

While not protective, they will now compensate in other ways..

**Features**
-ALL vanity items, when equipped in the Armor Slots, now grant a configurable set of bonuses: Movement Speed, Melee Speed, Damage, and Life Regeneration.
-Certain vanity items have unique bonuses of their own.

**Vanity Bonuses (More will be added)**
-Gravedigger set: Melee.
-Funeral set: Ranged.
